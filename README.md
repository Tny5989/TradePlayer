# TradePlayer
A windower addon for trading items with other players via commands.

Action                | Addon Command
--------------------- | -----------------------------
Trade                 | //tp \<quantity\> \<item name\> ... \[player name\]

The above command will do nothing if you already have an outstanding trade request.

As with all my addons, this is still a work in progress and should be used at your own risk.
